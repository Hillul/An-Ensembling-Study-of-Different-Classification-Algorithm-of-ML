# An-Ensembling-Study-of-Different-Classification-Algorithm-of-ML
The role of Classifier is significant. Classifier selection methods have been used in various applications of machine learning, bio-informatics, pattern recognition and network traffic analysis. In high dimensional datasets, a learning method consumes a significant amount of time and reduces the performance of the model. To overcome these problems, we compare the classifier first on the basis of accuracy and then on the basis of execution time. Classifier selected for datasetsare unstable in nature i.e., for different datasets, different classifier selected gives different accuracy.  In this paper we first study the different classifier in machine learning. Then, we compare 5 different classifiers (KNN, J48, Random Forest, SVM and Naive Bayes) on the basis of accuracy and execution time. For Comparing we use 10 datasets. Different classifier gives different accuracy, for a specified datasets. As such, we ensemble all the five classifier and study its accuracy and execution time.
